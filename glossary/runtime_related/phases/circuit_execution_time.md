# Circuit Execution Time
{: .fs-9 }
The quantum equivalent of the runtime, the duration a quantum circuit runs from start to full measurement. Usually accounts for the fact that quantum circuits have to be executed a certain number of times (called shots). Parameters may be filled in during this step. For hybrid programs, this is included in the runtime.
