## Full Definition

All responsibilities for code execution are handled by the runtime environment.
For performance reasons, some of these tasks are relegated to the operating system.
**Interpretation** of code is usually understood as part of the runtime, while **Compilation is not**.
Still, compilers are tightly connected with the runtime environment but technically not part of it.  

## Examples
