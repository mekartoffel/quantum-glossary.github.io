# Compilation
{: .fs-9 }
General term for the processing of abstract description into an actualized, generally more detailed representation.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Classical
{: .label }

## Full Definition
The general steps in classical compilation include:
- Lexing
- Parsing
- Transformation

During the transformation step, some optimization techniques are usually applied.
The word "Compilation" is also often used to describe the processing of a program written in an abstract programming language, into an executable binary.
There are two major approaches for compilation, namely:
1. Ahead-of-time (AOT)
2. Just-in-time (JIT)

**Performance Aware Compilation** has the explicit goal to optimize some performance indicators.

## Examples

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), the default GNU compilers.
