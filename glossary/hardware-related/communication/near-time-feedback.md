# Near-Time Feedback
{: .fs-9 }
Communication within a hybrid node, between classical and quantum components.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Classical
{: .label .label-green}

Quantum
{: .label .label-green }

## Full Definition
Communication between classical and quantum components occurs on-premise.
This is slower than real-time feedback but faster than accessing remote devices.
Communication can freely occur between shots, but this is usually undesirable.
