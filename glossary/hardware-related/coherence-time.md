# Coherence Time
{: .fs-9 }
Figuratively, the time it takes for a quantum state to be subject to energy decay or dephasing, limits the operation fidelity on the qudits involved.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Full Definition

The \\(T_1\\)-time (spin-lattice/longitudinal relaxation time) describes the probability of a qubit still being in \\(\ket{1}\\) after the time \\(t\\). 
The \\(T_2\\)-time (spin-spin/transverse relaxation time) describes the probability of a qubit still being in \\(\ket{+}\\) after the time \\(t\\).
